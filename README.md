# ecommerce_cart
this is a ecommerce website with main focus on ecom-cart done using HTML, CSS, a little jQuery, vanilla Javascript and bootstrap. 
It is designed along with its total quantity and tax calculations. Havent used database to store the products, only localstorage is used, since I wanted to learn how the data is locally stored on the site. Have used Mysql only for the validation purposes.

Though took help of Freecodecamp in building this, it has some extra functionalities like tax and others which is done by me without taking any help from any other tutorials.
